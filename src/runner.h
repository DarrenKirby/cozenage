 * @brief Executes Scheme code from a specified file.
 *
 * This function handles file opening, reading expressions sequentially,
 * and evaluating them without printing the result of each evaluation (non-REPL mode).
 * It includes a check for standard file extensions (.scm, .ss) and issues a
 * non-fatal warning otherwise.
 *
 * @param file_path The path to the Scheme source file.
 * @param config The configuration struct detailing which libraries to load.
 * @return EXIT_SUCCESS (0) on successful execution of the file,
 * or EXIT_FAILURE (1) if the file cannot be opened or a fatal
 * runtime error occurs during evaluation.
