The Cozenage Reference
======================

At some point, I will write some extensive documentation of the Scheme syntax, builtin procedures,
and Cozenage's extensions beyond the R5RS/R7RS specifications. That documentation will appear here.

In the infancy of this reference, much of the text is copied directly from the Scheme R7RS specification itself.
My gratitude to the authors of this report for explicitly allowing this. In time, I will replace the copied text with
text more personalized for Cozenage itself.
