Scheme Char Library
===================

Overview
--------

This library provides a suite of procedures for inspecting, converting, and comparing characters and strings. A key
feature is the robust support for case-insensitive operations, which are essential for tasks like parsing user input or
performing case-agnostic text searches.

Character procedures allow for the classification of characters (e.g., alphabetic, numeric, whitespace), while string
procedures provide tools for case conversion and comparison across entire strings. The ``-ci`` suffix in procedure names
like ``char-ci=?`` and ``string-ci<?`` indicate a case-insensitive comparison.
